### Introduction

In previous lessons we covered both stateful authentication (demonstrated using sessions) and stateless authentication (using JWTs). You will often see both approaches out in the wild, which may not necessarily be implemented with sessions or JWTs specifically, but why the options? What are the pros and cons of each? How should I authenticate my applications?

### Lesson overview
