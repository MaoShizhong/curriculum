### Introduction

Previously, we learned about using sessions to persist logins and authenticate users. Session data would be stored server-side and the client issued their session's ID via a cookie. When authenticating, the session store would be checked for a matching session. This kind of authentication is "stateful".

An alternative approach to authentication, and one that is common with REST APIs, is to use "stateless" authentication with JSON web tokens (JWTs). The main difference between using stateful and stateless authentication is where the authentication data is stored: client-side or server-side. In this lesson, you will be introduced to stateless authentication using JWTs.
